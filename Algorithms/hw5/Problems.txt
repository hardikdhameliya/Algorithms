(10 pts.) Prove that there is always a solution to the movie selection problem that contains the movie with the latest start.
(10 pts.) Write a greedy algorithm to solve the following problem:
input: lengths of nn print jobs l1, l2, ……, ln to be scheduled on a printer;

output: a schedule (ordering) of the print jobs that has the smallest average wait time (the wait time for a job is the total length of the jobs scheduled before it).

Prove that your algorithm always produces an optimal answer. What is the asymptotic running time of your algorithm ?

(10 pts.) Write a greedy algorithm to solve the following problem:
input: nn positive integers p1, p2, ……, pn, representing the positions of nn houses along a straight-line highway

output: the least number of cell-phone towers that must be built on this highway to guarantee that every house is within one mile to the left or right of a tower.

Prove that your algorithm always produces an optimal answer. What is the asymptotic running time of your algorithm ?

(10 pts.) Show that every (unrooted) tree has at least two vertices with degree 1.
(10 pts.) Let ee be a maximum-weight edge on some cycle of a connected weighted graph G=(V,E,W).
Show that there is an minimum-weight spanning tree of GG that does not include ee.
Use this fact to design an alternate MST algorithm.
